# dom-injector
**DOM Injector** is a lightweight Node.js tool that takes plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, minifies them, and bundles everything into a single self-contained script. This script dynamically injects your UI into the DOM at runtime, keeping source code hidden and reducing exposure in the pageâ€™s HTML source.
